
Revision History for orbitTools.core.lib library - Public version.

Version 1.0.01 12/21/2010

   Refactored cTle::ExpToDecimal(), in some cases it could cause rounding
   errors. Renamed the method to ExpToAtof().
   Removed assertion in cTle::Initialize(); the satellite name may
   now be a zero-length string.
   cTle::TrimRight() works properly on zero-length strings.

   
Version 1.0.00 10/30/2010

   Split the orbitTools project into two libraries:

      orbitTools.core.lib  - base functionality (cTle, cJulian, etc.)
      orbitTools.orbit.lib - all SGP4/SDP4 tracking code
      
   Dividing the project into two libraries allows an easier upgrade path
   for users who wish to transition to licensed versions of the
   software.
              
   Breaking changes from prior (single library) version:
              
   All methods renamed to Pascal casing. Classes and methods affected:
        
      Class cSite:
        getPosition() to GetPosition()
        getLookAngle() to GetLookAngle()
        
      Class cTle:
        getField() to GetField()
        getName() to GetName()
        getLine1() to GetLine1()
        getLine2() to GetLine2()
        radGet() to RadGet()
        degGet() to DegGet()
        
      Class cJulian:
        toGMST() to ToGmst()
        toLMST() to ToLmst()
        toTime() to ToTime()
        getComponent() to GetComponent()
        getDate() to GetDate()
        addDay() to AddDay()
        addHour() to AddHour()
        addMin() to AddMin()
        addSec() to AddSec()
        spanDay() to SpanDay()
        spanHour() to SpanHour()
        spanMin() to SpanMin()
        spanSec() to SpanSec()

      Class cEci:
        toGeo() to ToGeo()
        getPos() to GetPos()
        getVel()  to GetVel()
        getDate() to GetDate()
        setUnitsAe() to SetUnitsAe()
        setUnitsKm() to SetUnitsKm()
        ae2km() to Ae2Km()
        
   Renamed methods:
        
      Method cTle::mnMotion() renamed to MeanMotionTle().
      Method cTle::mnAnomaly() (2 overloads) renamed to MeanAnomaly().
      
   Other changes:

   Class cEci: Use member initialization list syntax for the constructor.
   Return cVector references from GetPos() and GetVel(). Thanks to S. Torri
   for these improvements.

   Compile with Visual Studio 2008.

   Revision history below this point was for the single-library version of
  the source code. Only comments relevant to the files that were moved into
   the core.lib library have been retained. All other comments were moved 
           into the revision notes file for the orbit.lib library.

01/25/2009 Repaired a debug assert call in cJulian.cpp that was incorrectly
           triggering when calculating dates on December 31 during leap
           years. Thanks to R. Kummerer for uncovering this problem.

10/16/2005 Do not use time_t type when calculating the epoch for ECI 
           coordinates. Thanks to the U.K's M. Trethewey for locating yet 
           another time_t problem.
           
           Updated class cJulian with a new constructor and "span" functions.
   
06/22/2005 MSVC++ 7.0 compiler/library change: pow(int, int) now returns 0 if
           the exponent is less than 0. Updated ExpToDecimal() to use 
           pow(double, double) instead. This was not pow() behavior in 
           MSVC++ 6.0. Thanks to Dr. Andy Register for first reporting this 
           issue.

08/29/2004 More time_t problems: A truncation error in CJulian::toTime() was
           causing time_t values to have an average error of 0.5 seconds from
           their Julian counterpart.
           
05/23/2004 Julian date class now calculates year, month, day, without using
           time_t type, which only has a resolution of 1 second. This was 
           causing errors when calculating azimuth and elevation for 
           satellites which pass near the zenith. Thanks to Markus Knapek 
           in Germany for first reporting this issue.
